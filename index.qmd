title: "Helpful R and Statistics Resources"

These pages are collections of resources that I've found helpful, particularly to fellow ecologists/environmental scientists, in learning R and/or statistics. Click on the pages in the top navigation bar to view.

If you could use R or statistics help, check out my business page at [www.catbirdstats.com](www.catbirdstats.com).
